      ## Introduction: The Need for Smart Learning in Competitive Exams  
      Preparing for NEET (National Eligibility cum Entrance Test) requires a well-structured, data-driven, and strategic approach to ensure success. With millions of students appearing for limited medical seats, traditional learning methods often fall short in providing real-time insights, personalized learning, and adaptive testing. Incorporating AI-driven assessment platforms like SmartPath into NEET preparation has significantly improved learning outcomes by identifying knowledge gaps, optimizing test strategies, and providing real-time performance analytics. This technological advancement is reshaping how students prepare, making learning more efficient, focused, and data-backed.

      ## Challenges with Traditional NEET Preparation Methods  
      Conventional coaching methods, while effective, have limitations when it comes to personalized learning and real-time assessment tracking:  
      - Static learning models ‚Äì Every student follows the same study plan, regardless of individual learning needs.  
      - Lack of performance insights ‚Äì Students struggle to identify weak areas due to the absence of real-time analytics.  
      - Inefficient test preparation ‚Äì Traditional mock tests do not adapt to individual progress, leading to repetitive and ineffective practice.  
      - Limited accessibility & flexibility ‚Äì Students must follow rigid schedules, which may not suit every learner.  
      This is where AI-driven platforms offer a significant advantage by enabling customized learning, instant feedback, and intelligent assessment strategies.
